🎮 How to Play
Game Rules:

The game is played by 2 players.
Players take turns to roll the dice.
The score from the dice gets added to the player's current score.
If a player rolls a 1, they lose all points for that turn, and the next player takes their turn.
A player can "Hold" their score to add it to their total score.
The first player to reach 100 points wins the game.

Controls:

Click "Roll Dice" to roll the dice.
Click "Hold" to save the current score.
Click "New Game" to restart the game.
